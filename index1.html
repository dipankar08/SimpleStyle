                    <p class="itemHeading ">Why the price is very high for this course?</p>
                    <p class="paragraph ">This course is not cheap as it pays for itself many times over. A job will get you a minimum base salary of $100K. If you are switching a job, it will get you a minimum raise of $10,000. As these skills last you a lifetime, so, if you switch 4 jobs in your life, that’s $60,000 just in raises. </p>

                <li>
                    <p class="itemHeading ">When should you start this course ?</p>
                    <p class="paragraph ">The best time is to start this course is when you are not happy with current employer and have started looking for another job or you already got a call from recruiter. If your interview is scheduled and you are not confident enough, you can start this course too.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="itemHeading ">There’s plenty of material online. Why do I need this course?</p>
                    <p class="paragraph ">That is the main reason we made this course. There are too many resources( interview questions) are available online which is not realistic to solves then all for the interview. This course gives you a clear structured approach to understand the fundamental concept and technique to solve the problem. This helps to solve the any unseen problem too.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="itemHeading ">What are the goals of these programs?</p>
                    <p class="paragraph ">The main aim to shift your mind and put it into interview mode and make you confident of cracking difficult software engineering interviews. This leaves you with a sense of having learned something useful in your daily life as a software engineer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="itemHeading ">What the programs are NOT?</p>
                    <p class="paragraph ">This course is not a substitute for an “algorithms class” or  “data structure class”. It is intense problem-solving work in an interview-like setting. They are not a list of "interview questions” which is to be solved.  It's about trying to bend your mind to think in the right way under interview pressure.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="itemHeading ">Why is it a 12 Week Bootcamp?</p>
                    <p class="paragraph ">Mastering interview algorithms and system design takes time. It’s important to take time to understand the problem-solving technique and fully prepare before appearing in the interview. It's hard to get an interview call and you definitely don't want to miss the opportunities. For a working software engineer, 12 weeks is a decent time to recap software engineering concept and prepare for the interview.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="itemHeading ">I already purchased "Cracking the Coding Interview"or other books. Do I need this course?</p>
                    <p class="paragraph ">Books are great, we love them too. However, no single book gives you all the right techniques. Thus, we have designed our own content which gives you more structured approach to complete the preparation in 12 weeks. This content comes with free of cost with this course.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="itemHeading ">What language does the course use?</p>
                    <p class="paragraph ">The problem-solving technique is language agnostic, so you can use any language you want code then .In general, we provide solutions in Pseudocode and C++/Java.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="itemHeading ">What are the prerequisites?</p>
                    <p class="paragraph ">A lot of these concepts are highly technical, so there is a minimum bar to attend this. We expect that you have good understanding core computer science concept and having basic coding skill. In the first call, we will assess you if you meet this bar. We will  also send you a crisp list of preparation once you enroll.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="itemHeading ">Can I be kicked out of the course?</p>
                    <p class="paragraph ">Ok! We won't physically kick you.  But, if we feel that if doesn’t meet the bar,  we reserve the right to ask you to leave or to have some extra session which might cost you.</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="itemHeading ">How the full course is structured ?</p>
                    <p class="paragraph ">The course has 3 main components – (1) Revisiting Data-Structure and Algorithm (2) Problem solving techniques (3) Solving Design problem. All of these components are designed to be completed in 12 Weeks.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph ">Each live session is weekly for 2 hours over video conference. In each session, we will cover 1-5 problem solving techniques and some question related to this. In case of mock interview sessions: in first hour, we will have a mock interview and next hours will be feedback on interview + detailed analysis of the solution.</p>
